# Predicting inpatient Length of Stay
<p1> Using Machine Learning to Predict Hospital Length of stay(admission days) for Patients with `SCHIZOPHRENIA and other PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS.`</p1>
<p2>Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling disorder, which causes impairments in everyday functioning and involves major functional domains of independence in residence, productive activities, and social interactions.</p2>
<p3>The ability to predict how long a patient will stay, only with information available as soon as they enter the hospital and are diagnosed, can therefore have many positive effects for a hospital and its efficiency. A model that can predict patient length of stay could allow hospitals to better analyze the factors that influence length of stay the most.</p3>

### Data: 
The data used for the analysis and Model creation is the NY Hospital Inpatient Discharges dataset gotten from <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/dataset/Hospital-Inpatient-Discharges-SPARCS-De-Identified/22g3-z7e7">New York State Government health data website</a>

### Stacks:
<li>Cogram</li><li>Plotly</li><li>Matplotlib</li><li>Scikit learn librabries</li><li>Gradio(for deploying the demo model)</li><li>pandas</li><li>Numpy</li><li>Seaborn</li>
